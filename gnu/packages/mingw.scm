development environment for creating native Microsoft Windows applications.

It includes a set of Windows-specific header files and static import libraries
which enable the use of the Windows API.  It does not rely on any third-party C
runtime dynamic-link libraries (@dfn{DLL}s).

Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project and provides
several new APIs such as DirectX and DDK, and 64-bit support.")
